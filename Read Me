🚦 Traffic Rule Violation Analyzer (Java)
📌 Project Overview

This Java console application simulates a traffic inspection system that analyzes riders for common traffic rule violations.
It processes data for 10 riders, checks eligibility based on age, helmet usage, and license possession, and generates a final violation report.

The project focuses on looping concepts, conditional logic, counters, and real-world problem solving.
